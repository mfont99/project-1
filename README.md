Data cleaning: Data was cleaned in the following ways: 

    Dropped unnecessary columns such as “Timestamp” and “Permissions”
    Dropped rows that were missing entries either “Age” or “Music effects”
    Removed “BPM” data that was clearly inaccurate and settled on scientifically noted range of  (<40 BPM or >300 BPM).
    Renamed around half the columns to be less redundant and easier to work with.

Data insights: 

    The streaming service were distributed across age groups with Spotify (64.3%) being most popular and majoirty being the younger generation while Pandora is most commonly used by those 35 years of age and older. 
    Rock is the most popular music genre across all age groups.
    While popular genres did change by age group Rock, Pop, and Metal were consistently the choice across the board
    A majority of participants are in their late teens to early twenties, mainly reflecting the modes of accessing the surveys ( social media played a key role in outreach).
    Having a background in music had little to no impact on the average severity of experienced mental health disorders
