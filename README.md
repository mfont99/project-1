Data cleaning: Data was cleaned in the following ways: 

    Dropped unnecessary columns such as “Timestamp” and “Permissions”
    Dropped rows that were missing entries either “Age” or “Music effects”
    Removed “BPM” data that was clearly inaccurate and settled on scientifically noted range of  (<40 BPM or >300 BPM).
    Renamed around half the columns to be less redundant and easier to work with.

Data insights: 

    The most popular streaming service was Spotify (64.3%)
    Pandora is most commonly used by those 35 years of age and older
    Rock is the most popular music genre
    While popular genres did change by age group Rock, Pop, and Metal were consistently in the top 3
    A majority of forms were submitted by participants in their late teens to early twenties
    Having a background in music had little to no impact on the average severity of experienced mental health disorders
